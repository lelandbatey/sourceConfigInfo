#   Description:   #
####################
This is a simple script that will tell you what your binds are in a source game.
It analyzes what your config.cfg file contains, then it outputs to the console (and optionally
to a file).

It will ask for the location of a Source game's 'cfg' folder, then it will open the
config file and tell you:
 1. What keys have binds, and what those keys are bound to.
 2. The keys that could have binds, but don't.

 - What am I even doing
 Bugs:
 - My program is OBVIOUSLY perfect. Nothing to change here.
