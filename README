         SourceConfigInfo
----------------------------------

SourceConfigInfo is a short and simple python script for getting information about a Source engine game's Config.cfg file.

Specifically, it will tell you:
 1. What keys have binds.
 2. The commands that are bound to each key
 3. What keys are't bound to anything.
